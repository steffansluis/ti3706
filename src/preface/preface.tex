In the growing world of tools and methods that are available to a software developer, it becomes harder and harder to keep track of which technique is best to use under what circumstances. This holds true for the growing field of performance regression testing, where new testing strategies are being discovered and discussed, and the steps in the process of detecting performance regressions are being improved constantly. This literature study aims to give an overview of these steps in a way that links each step to a point in the software development process corresponding to the challenges that arise when dealing with performance regression testing in practice.
