In the growing world of tools and methods that are available to software developers, it becomes harder and harder to keep track of which technique is best to use under what circumstances. This holds true for the growing field of performance regression testing. New testing strategies are being discovered and discussed, and the steps in the process of detecting performance regressions are being improved constantly. This literature study gives an overview of these steps in a way that links each step to a point in the software development process. Each chapter describes a step and the corresponding challenges that arise when dealing with performance regression testing in practice.
