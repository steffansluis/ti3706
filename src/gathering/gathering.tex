This chapter will explain how the gathering of useful data will be done. First it will expalin the organising aspects, where the second part is about how to present data in the form of performance counters.
\section{Method of development}
Software development processes have different methods of software development. Different types of development mean different types of testing. This section show different types of development and how to do performance regression testing on those methods.
\subsection{Code-and-fix model}
``The basic model used during the early days of software devolpment contained two steps: write some code and fix the problems in the code'' \cite{boehm1988spiral} This model relies on top programmers and most of the time resulted in poor results\cite{maccormack2003trade}. This `method' is not appropriate for performance regression testing. In a late stadium of developing it will be hard to tell which part of the software has regressions, not mentioning detecting loss in quality.
