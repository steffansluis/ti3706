Performance regression testing brings challanges with it. In this paper we discuss what these challenges are, how they are handled and what problems still remain. It shows when it is useful to start performance regression testing during the development. How the data for the tests are gathered. What can be done to process the gathered data. And how to report on it. Ultimately there is still work to be done in the subject, but the paper shows that performance regression testing is a useful method of testing.
