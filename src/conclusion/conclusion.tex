This paper shows that performance regression testing could help the developer improve their system. To do so the developer needs to gather performance metrics, process this data and draw meaningful conclusions out of it. If all these steps are made, the developer can tell what kind of performance regressions have occurred, so he/she can adjust his/her system. Performance regression testing is a rather new subject in the Information Technology field. This means that it can be further investigated. Some of these future experiments can be found in the research agenda.
