The definition of performance regression testing is: ``Performance regression testing detects performance
regressions in a system under load. Such regressions refer to
situations where software performance degrades compared to
previous releases, although the new version behaves correctly.''\cite{Definition}
Performance regression testing can be seen as the combination of regression testing and performance testing. Regression testing, tests if a system still works after an update has been made. Performance testing is testing in a way so that the performance quality won't be lost. 
To improve the quality of the software product it could be useful to use PRT in a way the developers can
directly improve the quality of the software product. A timeline when to make use of PRT in the development
process could be useful.
